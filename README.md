Objective:
To create a simple circuit and write a program that makes an LED blink at regular intervals using an Arduino board.

Components Required:
Arduino Board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
LED
Resistor (220 ohms to 1k ohms, typically 220 ohms)
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
USB Cable (to connect Arduino to computer)
Concept:
An LED will be connected to one of the digital output pins of the Arduino. By writing a simple program (sketch) in the Arduino IDE, you can control this pin to turn the LED on and off, creating a blinking effect.

Understanding the Components:
Arduino Board:

A microcontroller board that can be programmed to perform various tasks.
Has multiple input/output pins to interface with other electronic components.
LED:

A diode that emits light when an electric current passes through it.
Has two legs: the anode (longer leg, positive) and the cathode (shorter leg, negative).
Resistor:

Limits the current flowing through the LED to prevent it from burning out.
The resistance value (e.g., 220 ohms) is chosen to ensure safe current levels for the LED.
Circuit Diagram:
Connecting the LED:
Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to one of the digital pins on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13).
Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to one end of the resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND (ground) pin on the Arduino.

Steps:
1. Hardware Setup:
LED Anode (long leg) to a digital pin (e.g., pin 13).
LED Cathode (short leg) to ground (GND) through a resistor.
Alternatively, use a breadboard to make the connections:
Insert the LED into the breadboard.
Connect a jumper wire from the Arduino pin 13 to the anode of the LED.
Connect the cathode of the LED to one end of the resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin on the Arduino.

Conclusion:
This project is a fundamental exercise in using an Arduino to control an LED. 
It teaches the basics of setting up hardware, writing and uploading a program, and understanding how to use digital output pins. 
This knowledge is foundational for more complex projects involving sensors, actuators, and other components.
